# Claude Instructions for wellmaintained-skills

**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs.

## JavaScript Tooling

**IMPORTANT**: Use `bun` instead of `npm` for all JavaScript/TypeScript operations:
- `bun install` (not `npm install`)
- `bun run build` (not `npm run build`)
- `bun test` (not `npm test`)
- `bun run <script>` (not `npm run <script>`)

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for complete workflow details, including:
- Essential bd commands
- Issue types and priorities
- Workflow for AI agents
- MCP server setup
- Important rules and best practices
